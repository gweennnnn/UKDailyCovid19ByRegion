# UKDailyCovid19ByRegion


## Daily Updated COVID-19 cases for UK
This repo contains data on the day by day cases of COVID-19 around the United Kingdom. Each day, a new csv file will be added to this repo, and will serve as a daily snapshot of the growth of COVID-19 cases.

Number of cases include those that have recovered.

Feel free to use this data on visualisations - I would love to see them!

Numbers are officially released on the Public Health England's COVID-19 dashboard in which data was scrapped from on a daily basis to act as a snapshot. I do not claim the accuracy or responsibility of any of these numbers.
